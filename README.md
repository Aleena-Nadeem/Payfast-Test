# Payfast-Test
Payfast Website Task


I have completed the task in Node JS and completed all of the three points except few shortcomings in frontend. 
Heroku is not free anymore. 


makepayment.html file is for making the payment and saving the transactions to DB. The database used is Sqlite3

inquireTransaction is for inquiring payment status.
